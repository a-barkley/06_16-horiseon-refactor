# 06/16 Horiseon Refactor

## Deployed Link: https://pbarkley.github.io/06_16-horiseon-homework/ 

## Description

Webpage for Horiseon. Includes Horiseon header and navigation bar with links to the three
articles on the page. The articles include information on Search Engine Optimization, 
Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.

## Changes to Original Code

- Changed h2 tag to h4 so that the headings are in sequential order
- Added alt tag to each image
- Fixed the Search Engine Optimization button by adding a class tag
- Changed .class tags to #id tags, since they only affect 1 element
- Changed outside div tags to reflect the content
